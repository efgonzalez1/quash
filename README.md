quash
=====

This is a Quash data structure implementation that I made for CS130A at UCSB in the Spring 2014 quarter. A Quash is composed of both a min-heap (priority queue) and a hash table. The advantage of this data struture is that it supports inserts, delete and lookup using its hash component, and deleteMin using its heap component.

How to Use
==========

Open up your terminal and type the following:

    make prog1
    ./prog1 < test_input.txt
